# Financial Performance Analysis of Adidas

## Project Summary

This project delves into the analysis of a company's financial performance over the last five years. The focus is on creating a detailed Profit and Loss (P&L) statement structure, applying formatting, looking up source data, calculating margins and growth rates, creating visualizations, and interpreting the data to provide valuable insights.

## Problem & Key Questions

The primary challenge addressed in this project is to comprehensively analyze and interpret a company's financial data. Key questions include:

1. How can we structure and format the P&L statement to gain a clear understanding of the company's financial performance?
2. What are the revenue breakdowns by product and geography, and how can they be incorporated into the P&L structure?
3. How can we accurately transfer data from the source sheet to the P&L table using lookup functions?
4. What are the key profitability metrics, such as gross profit margin and EBIT margin, and how have they evolved over the last five years?
5. What is the company's revenue growth rate, and how can it be calculated using Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)?
